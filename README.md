# AI_SEC
This repo is intended to help you to deal with AI Ethics and CyberSecurity.
I hope you find it useful.
First of all, please have a look at a ML High Level Design:

Here you can see the first step: Addressing a business goal with a Machine Learning Model. Gather the requirements and design it to match the requirements.
Once the ML Model is designed, the next step must be designing and building the system and infrastructure that will support the model.
Once the infrastructure is in place, you can start building or acquiring datasets, preprocessing and processing them.
After you have prepared your datasets, it's time to train your model, fine tune it and evaluate its performance.
When you ML Model is matching the requirements, you can deploy it and start to monitor it.
There should be a continous feedback between your datasets and your models for continous improvement.
External knowledge bases and feature stores can provide extra performance.

You must analise it from the AI Adversarial, CyberSecurity, InfoSec and Data Security perspective.
